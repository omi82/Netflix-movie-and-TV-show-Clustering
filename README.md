# Netflix movie and TV show Clustering

# **Problem Statement**

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

## Project Summary

This project aims to cluster Netflix movies and TV shows based on their similarities using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to group together movies and shows that share similar characteristics, such as genre, release year, and user ratings. By doing so, users can more easily discover new content that they might enjoy based on their preferences.

## Methods

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect data from the Kaggle website an existing dataset containing information about Netflix movies and shows.
   - Extract relevant features such as title, genre, release year, and user ratings.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and prepare the data for clustering.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize the data if necessary.

3. **Clustering:**
   - Apply unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as K-means or hierarchical clustering to group the movies and shows into clusters.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters based on the data and the desired level of granularity.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as silhouette score.
   - Analyze the clusters to understand the characteristics of each group.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the clusters using scatter plots or dendrograms to show the relationships between the movies and shows.

## Benefits

- Improved content discovery for Netflix users.
- Personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
- Identification of trends and patterns in Netflix content.

## Conclusion

By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to Netflix movie and TV show data, this project can provide valuable insights into the content available on the platform and help users find new and interesting content to watch.
